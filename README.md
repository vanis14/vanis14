Welcome! I am Vanis, a Business Information System Honored Bachalor graduate, and currently preparing for my first AWS certificate "Solutions Architect - Associate". 

I have a Business Information Systems Bachelor Degree with working experience in Data Science. I am also experienced in web development and small scale IT infrastructure deployment. 
I am currently looking for opportunities in Cloud related positions and actively developing my skills through small projects. These projects will be updated onto my portfolio website and also github if applicable in the near future.

If you are interested to find out more about me, you can reach me through my website http://portfolio.vanislim.com/.
